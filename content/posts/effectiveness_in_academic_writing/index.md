## Introduction

## Accuracy

## Clarity

## Conciseness

> <cite>The flow of electrical current can induce the migration of impurities or other defects through the bulk of a solid. This process is called electromigration. In simple electromigration, the force on the defect is thought to have two components. The first component is the force created by direct interaction between the effective charge of the defect and the electric field that drives the current. The second component, called the "wind force", is the force caused by the scattering of electrons at the defect.[^1]</cite>

在这个示例中，用四个关键字总结：已知信息（Known）、未知信息（Unknown）、给出定义（Given）和新内容（New）。在引文中，

首先，作者给出本领域的已知信息*The flow of electrical current can induce the migration of impurities through the bulk of a solid.* 同时，这段内容中包含未知信息*other defects*。随后，作者给这段内容做出了定义*In simple electromigration, the force on the defect is thought to have two components.* 最后，作者对新的信息做出新的说明。
